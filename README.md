# Smote_Variants
> This project contains the effort to find the right model to predict for a imbalanced dataset. I use different oversamplers (all based on SMOTE) techniques to try to solve this weakness on the dataset. A mention to right metric selection and the results of the metrics. Execution of the algorithms and all the process of cleaning the and modelling is included in _Smote Variants_ while the results on the competition with Kaggle are visualized in _State of Art_.

This repository contains:
- Smote varints: Data Cleaning and preparing for modelling, oversampling stage with 5 different oversamplers, prediction stage with 3 boosted learning classifiers and some findings and comments on results obtained.
- State of Art : To context our results, 30 notebooks selected by upvotes were picked from the kaggle competition on the dataset. These notebooks are compared to each other and finally compared with our model. It also contains a SMOTE representation.
